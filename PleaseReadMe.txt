Dear TA: 

Please run my app from Visual Studio IDE The old fashion way. Rebuild and run. You need : Client3 Server and WpfClient

There was some port errors when I tried to run it from command prompt and run.bat file. 
I don't know why the port does not get initialized.  This week is Thanksgiving holidays so probably all of you 
somewhere in Florida walking with shorts and flip-flops. 


Note that: 

My GUI is designed that you have to pick one query up from selection box
and then you have to provide the nesseccary data in fields and press 
Send Query. Query result willdisplay in box below. 

Don't worry about filling all the fields. ONLY fill-up the fields that are relevant 
to the query you picked in step1. 

So Steps: 
1. Pick up query from drop down. 
2. Fill up fields only relavant to that query. 
3. press Send Query. 
4. Query result and time get updated in related boxes. 

You cannot send multiple query from this GUI.
